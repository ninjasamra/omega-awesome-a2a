### MM-REACT: Multimodal Reasoning and Action System
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11381) | [Project Page](https://multimodal-react.github.io/)

MM-REACT represents a breakthrough in multimodal AI by introducing a novel system paradigm that combines ChatGPT with specialized vision experts. Its innovative prompt design enables seamless integration of text descriptions, spatial coordinates, and dense visual signals, allowing for advanced visual reasoning tasks previously beyond the reach of existing vision-language models. The system's ability to perform zero-shot reasoning across multiple images, documents, and videos while maintaining interpretability makes it particularly valuable for real-world applications.

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Example prompt structure for MM-REACT
prompt = f"""
Task: {task_description}
Image Context: {image_description}
Spatial Information: {coordinates}
Visual Analysis: {expert_output}
Question: {user_query}
"""

# Integration with vision experts
def process_multimodal_input(image, text):
    # 1. Extract visual features using vision experts
    visual_features = vision_expert.analyze(image)
    
    # 2. Format prompt with extracted information
    formatted_prompt = create_mm_react_prompt(
        visual_features,
        text_input=text
    )
    
    # 3. Generate reasoning output
    response = llm.generate(formatted_prompt)
    return response
